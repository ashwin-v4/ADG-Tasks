# ADG TASKS

Created this project for submission of ADG club tasks.
Was given a dataset about AI-Ml salaries and was asked to create a model on it.
Data preprocessing, Data cleaning, feature Selection and Scaling is done.

Models I used are: Linear Regression,
            Decision Trees,
            Random Forests,
            Gradient Boosting regressor.

Learnt a lot of EDA and had hands on learning on Gradient Boosting regressor algorithm.

Done by me and it was fun doing it.
